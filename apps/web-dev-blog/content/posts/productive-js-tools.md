## 1. Volta

Are you telling your team to install a particular version of Node.js for a project? Or working with multiple projects requiring different Node.js versions

With [Volta](https://volta.sh/) you can install multiple Node.js versions and can pin Node.js version for a project

`volta install node@v14.17.3` will install Node.js v14.17.3

`volta pin node@16.15.0` will add entry in `package.json` file for Node v16.15.0

Volta will automatically switch Node versions for projects with pinned Node.js version
