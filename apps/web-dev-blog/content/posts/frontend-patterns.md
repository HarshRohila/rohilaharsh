This post is about common patterns found in modern frontend frameworks.

## 1. Template

As HTML is what is rendered in browser, so all frameworks provide a way to express HTML/templates.

HTML in itself is very limited. It doesn't provide conditional rendering of HTML elements or way of looping to render same elements in a list. For implementing the condition and loop logic we need JavaScript, but frameworks provide a way to do this in templates only. It makes these logics declarative (as HTML is declarative itself). Declarative code is much easier to understand.
