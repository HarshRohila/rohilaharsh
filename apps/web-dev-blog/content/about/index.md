Hi

I am **Harsh Rohila**, working as a Software Engineer

This blog is to share what I learned from my experience in this field.

### My Experience

I started with learning _JavaScript_ and got to work on an [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) project. If you don't know Ember.js it is an underrated frontend framework with principle of convention over configuration

After learning Ember.js, I started looking into other Frontend techs like React, Svelte and Stencil. Now I use [Stencil.js](https://stenciljs.com/) to build web components.

I am also having experience with Serverless Backend APIs as I worked with [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) to convert Java APIs to Node.js APIs

Also having experience about DevOps as I used [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) and [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) to build pipelines to deploy Frontend and Serverless Backend apps
