Hi

I am **Harsh Rohila**, working as a Software Engineer

This blog is to share what I learned from my experience in this profession.

I started with learning JavaScript and got to work on an Ember.js project. If you don't know Ember.js it is an underrated frontend framework with principle of convention over configuration

After learning Ember.js and its conventions, I started looking into other Frontend frameworks. Now working with Stencil.js to build web components

I also worked on Backend side using Serverless Framework
