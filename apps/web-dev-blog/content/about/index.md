Hi

I am **Harsh Rohila**, working as a Senior Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience.

Below is my experience graph

{{< custom-canvas id="exp-chart" height="400px" >}}

I am a **Frontend-heavy TypeScript Full Stack** Developer, currently leading the development of a React.js application. I have extensive experience in developing **Kubernetes**, **Serverless** Apps(AWS) and **Web Components**(Stencil.js), and also doing **CI/CD** with Jenkins and AWS CodePipelines. I am using TypeScript(AWS CDK) to create all AWS **Cloud infrastructure**

This blog is to share what I learned from my experience in this field.

### Background

I started with learning _JavaScript_ and got to work on an [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) project. If you don't know Ember.js it is an underrated frontend framework with principle of convention over configuration

After learning Ember.js, I started looking into other Frontend techs like React, Svelte and Stencil. Then I used [Stencil.js](https://stenciljs.com/) to build web components. Over the years, I've developed deep expertise in React.js and now lead the development of a React.js application.

With my frontend-heavy background, I bring a user-centric approach to full-stack development, ensuring seamless integration between frontend experiences and backend systems.

I am also having experience with Serverless Backend APIs as I worked with [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) to convert Java APIs to Node.js APIs

Also having experience about DevOps as I used [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) and [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) to build pipelines to deploy Frontend and Serverless Backend apps
