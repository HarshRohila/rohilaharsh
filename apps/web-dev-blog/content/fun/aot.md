## Why?

Its one of the Best Stories I came across yet.

Some series are worth your time. These are the type which demonstrates how creative humans can be. If story writing is an intelligence, the writer of this show is a genius.

## About this show

Attack on Titan is an [anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime), which started in 2013. Its having 4 seasons. As of writing this post, its IMBD rating is 9.1.

## Environment of the show

Man-eating Titans appeared 100 years ago and Humans found safety behind massive walls that stopped the giant Titans. But this safety is gone when a gigantic Titan appears and smashes a wall.

## What is so good in this show?

The story is having many characters. It is interesting to watch how these different characters behaves in this environment.

Also, the environment is having many mysteries involved which leaves the viewer curious about it.

Many times the writer shows a scene which shocks user for that moment and after a while the explanation of the scene is given.

The show doesn't feel like it is being dragged.

Also, some weird things happen in show which leaves viewer in mystery, but after watching till 3rd season everything get connected and everything happened before makes sense.

Some scenes in the show are very well directed, the animation, the music, the reaction of characters, all fits very well. I think it's what makes anime stand out than non-anime. Anime have more control over how scene is directed and acting of all characters.
