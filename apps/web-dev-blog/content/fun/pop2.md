## About

This is a PC game released in 2004. I used to play this game in school days and had lots of fun.

This is the 2nd part of the [Prince of Persia Trilogy](<https://princeofpersia.fandom.com/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_Trilogy_(HD_Collection)>).

All 3 games in the trilogy are good, but this 2nd part was the best of them.

## What I loved

- At that time I didn't understood the game story, I just used to love the parkour type of moves which we can do in this game and finding the way through this adventure game.

- And one of the best thing in this is, a point comes when the player thinks he completed the game. But actually that was only half of the game.

- When I understood the story later, I was fascinated. The story involves time travelling and our character(the Prince) uses it in clever ways.

- I would highly recommend everyone to play this game. Its lot of fun, with a wonderful story. Or if you don't feel playing you can watch the story on YouTube.

- All 3 games have connected stories, and it is recommended to watch them in order.

## Movie

There is also a [Prince of Persia Sands of Time Movie](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia:_The_Sands_of_Time_(film)>). This movie is based on the 1st part of the game trilogy. The movie is good, but unfortunately the movie was not well received by audience. So there would be no sequel.

This is disappointing, as the sequel game was the best, so its movie would have been awesome.

## New game

There is remake for 1st part of the game which is in development now [Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/prince-of-persia/sands-of-time-remake).

I hope this game to be a success, so Ubisoft can remake the 2nd part of the game too. That game truly deserves a remake.
